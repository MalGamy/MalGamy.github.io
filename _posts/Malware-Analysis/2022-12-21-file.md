This attack chain begins with the victim receiving a malicious RTF file through a phishing attack. When the victim opens the RTF file, it contains a hidden encoded file which is then decoded and executed using a shellcode. The executed file then performs process hollowing, injecting itself into the rundll32.dll process and establishing a connection with the attacker's command and control (C2) server.

Once connected to the C2 server, the infected machine begins sending data about itself to the attacker, who can then use this information to send further modules and commands to the infected machine.
