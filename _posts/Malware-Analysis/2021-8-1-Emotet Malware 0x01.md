# Introduction


# Examine Emotet with DIE
I will open malware with Detect It Easy tool to see some information about Emotet malware like compiler,type of packer if malware author use commercial packer to pack malware with it and type of linker and more information, so we can see the results in the next figure.

From the previous figure 1, we can identify some information about Emotet malware like as compiler and linker and the time that malware has been compiled on it and malware author can fake the time and the number of the sections that find in malware. Now I will examine the entropy to see if malware is packed or not and entropy is a good indicator that use by malware analysts to detect packed and some other techniques and we can see the results in the next figure.

From the previous figure we can see the four sections and packed section which called rdata and see the 7.15835 number which give us good indicator that Emotet malware is packed.

Now we will examine the section with pestudio tool to get overview about section and some information about every section, so we can see four section in malware and we have one packed section which called .text that has high entropy number and we can see also that .text section is executable and we can see the results in the next figure.

If we examine the strings of malware, we can identify  a lot of malicious strings that can have us to get information about the behavior of malware and what it tries to do on a system and we can see the black list in the next figure.

After examining malware with static analysis tool, we can open with a great tool which called ida pro to help us to understand assembly code and functionalities of malware that try to execute them and great tool also to identify packed malware with some techniques and we can see the following techniques that we can help us to identify if malware is packed or not.
